@1 /*Bodhi*/ = ~<CHARNAME>, I flee. When I am whole I will find you, if you live.~
@2 /*Bodhi*/ = ~The sun, it burns! I will find you later.~

//1st Hexxat Talk
@3 /*Hexxat*/ = ~You are wearing my cloak.~
@4 /*Bodhi*/ = ~It was Dragomir's cloak, was it not? <CHARNAME> killed Dragomir which makes it <CHARNAME>'s cloak, and <CHARNAME> gave it to me.~
@5 /*Hexxat*/ = ~You must return it to me.~
@6 /*Bodhi*/ = ~Must I? It was a treasured gift.~
@7 /*Bodhi*/ = ~I think I will keep it. Any complaints must go to our leader.~
@8 /*Hexxat*/ = ~This is unacceptable, <CHARNAME>. I cannot move in sunlight without it.~
@9 /*CHARNAME*/ = ~Sorry, Hexxat, I need Bodhi more than you.~
@10 /*CHARNAME*/ = ~You'll just have to find another one.~
@11 /*CHARNAME*/ = ~There's two vampires and one cloak; you'll just have to learn to share.~
@12 /*CHARNAME*/ = ~Hexxat's right, Bodhi, you need to return it.~
@13 /*Hexxat*/ = ~This is disappointing. I hope you will change your mind.~
@14 /*Bodhi*/ = ~You give it to me only to ask for its return? My heart is broken, <CHARNAME>. With the sun denied me, I will sulk in the dark.~

//2nd Hexxat Talk
@15 /*Bodhi*/ = ~It seems that Dragomir's cloak is not as unique as I thought.~
@16 /*Hexxat*/ = ~He was a large vampire. When I had an opportunity, I recut his cloak and made two. I did not need the spare until now.~
@17 /*Hexxat*/ = ~It is clear that <CHARNAME> relies on you. I will have to accept your company as well.~
