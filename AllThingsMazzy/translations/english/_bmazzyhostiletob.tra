@1 /*Mazzy*/ = ~By Arvoreen, I swear that you shall go no further. Stand and fight, if you have the courage.~
@2 /*Mazzy*/ = ~For Arvoreen!~
@201 /*Sarevok*/ = ~Fool. You think you will be able to kill <CHARNAME> where I failed? We shall make trophies of your bones.~
@3 /*Viconia*/ = ~Now she turns on us as I knew she would! Sanctimonious halfling, it is time for you to die!~
@301/*Viconia (if Mazzy friend)*/ = ~I will... not choose between you. Battle it out if you must, but I will stand to the side.~
@4 /*Korgan (if Mazzy has killed him)*/ = ~I said me axe was yers, Mazzy, an’ I meant it. Ready yerself, <CHARNAME>, fer today is th' day ye die!~
@5 /*Korgan (if Mazzy hasn't killed him)*/ = ~Har, har, no one tells me what t' do. Time t' take me axe, girl.~
@6 /*Keldorn*/ = ~<CHARNAME>, I know that you bring with you a troubled past and a painful heritage, but for all the friendship that has formed between us, I cannot turn from such transgressions forever.~ [KELDOR82]
@7 /*Keldorn*/ = ~I cannot allow you to do this, and if that means ending your life then so be it.~

@9 /*Minsc (Charisma <15)*/ = ~You have fallen to evil while I watched, but no more! Now is the time for justice! Boo will have your eyes!~
@10 /*Minsc (Charisma 15*/ = ~No more words, <CHARNAME>. I thought we were friends but your pretty lies have blinded me to evil for too long. Boo will have your eyes when next me meet.~ [MINSC89]
@11 /*Aerie*/ = ~How—how could you do this, <CHARNAME>? I trusted you. Everyone trusted you!~

@13 /*HaerDalis (if Aerie and not romancing CN)*/ = ~Ahh, my awakened mourning dove, you sing truly about <CHARNAME>. <PRO_HESHE> is a monster, but fear not! Your sparrow will help you bring <PRO_HIMHER> down.~
@14 /*HaerDalis (if no Aerie or if Romancing CN)*/ = ~What bitter betrayals and twisted friendships, what songs this day will sing. Fight and we shall carve in blood a villain’s destiny!~

@19 /*Neera (not romancing)*/ = ~Now you're fighting? But who do I help? I know! I will decide to refuse to decide. You two do what you're going to do and I'll go with the winner when you're done.~

@21 /*Valygar*/ = ~I'll not stand about and participate in your degenerate activities any longer, <CHARNAME>. I'll find my own way and leave you to yours.~

@28 /*Rasaad (romancing or Charisma 15)*/ = ~I thought you were a light within the darkness I must walk and I cannot believe that I was wrong. I will not help you fight now, but neither will I abandon you. If you win, we will continue our travels.~ 
@29 /*Nalia (normal)*/ = ~I can't believe you would do this, <CHARNAME>! We're supposed to be helping people!~
@291 /*Nalia (romancing or keep owner)*/ = ~I don't understand this. I thought you were a hero, <CHARNAME>. You were my hero.... I am leaving, <CHARNAME>. Goodbye.~
@33 /*Imoen (if not romancing and not angry)*/ = ~All right, fine. If that's the way you wanna be, go ahead and be pigheaded. I'll be at that bar... the Copper Coronet. You can find me there, I suppose, if you ever want to.~ [IMOEN78]

@41 /*Jan*/ = ~Well now here is a pickle. Not an actual pickle mind you, but a pickle meaning a problem, and not a problem relating to pickles like the one that befell my cousin Plooty. This was before he became a famous flesh-golem eater of course...~

//After Combat Starts
@42 /*Jan (once combat ends)*/ = ~...and by the time he was done arguing with the orc general, the entire orc army had already died of old age; orcs don't live that long you know. Now what was it you were all shouting about?~
@43 /*Korgan (if Mazzy dies)*/ = ~Well, that be that. No hard feelings, <CHARNAME>. Let us raise a mug an' drink t' Mazzy, the most fearsome halfling what ever lived.~
