@1 /*Renal Bloodscalp*/ = ~You... yes, you girl. You're one of ours, aren't you?~
@2 /*OHHFAK*/ = ~Yes? I am with <CHARNAME>... <PRO_HESHE> is taking me to Dragomir's Tomb.~
@3 /*Renal*/ = ~Tomb robbing? That's dangerous work, especially with so many undead about. I admire your initiative, though I encourage caution as well.~
@4 /*Renal*/ = ~You should make sure to work during the day. There's a risk of guards, but better them than the undead. I'm sorry to say that we've completely lost control of the graveyard at night.~
@5 /*Renal*/ = ~Bring her back safely, <CHARNAME>. She's a pretty thing, clearly ambitious, and this guild cannot afford to lose anyone else.~
