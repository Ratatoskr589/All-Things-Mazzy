@1 /*Hexxat Dead- create bag*/ = ~You defeat the vampire, but she transforms into mist and quickly disappears. All that remains where she stood is an old sack. Perhaps if you took it, you could hunt the creature down.~
@2 /*Hexxat Dead- have bag but not stake*/ = ~The vampire is regenerating in her casket inside the old sack. If you had a stake, you could end her life forever.~
@3 /*Hexxat dead- have bag and stake*/ = ~You drive a stake through the vampire's heart and end her existence. With the vampire destroyed, her victim breathes again.~
@4 /*Journal*/ = ~Dragomir's Tomb was a trap. The one I knew as Hexxat was a thrall under the control of a vampire, one who wished to speak with me. But I do not treat with monsters. I have killed the vampire and freed this girl's soul. Hopefully she will be better at making conversation now.~
