== JAHEIRAJ @1 /*That is a personal matter, and not one I will share with you. Do you have no manners?*/
== MAZZYJ @2 /*It is not a rude question. All of my people ask the ages of everyone they meet. You cannot even speak most halfling languages without knowing the relative age of the person you are addressing.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @3 /*We are not speaking halfling, we are speaking common, and...*/
= @4 /*When do halflings speak halfling? I don't think I've ever heard it.*/
== MAZZYJ @5 /*It is considered rude to speak it in front of the tall folk. We never do so except in emergencies. I think it is also a safety measure to prevent tall folk from ever learning one of our languages. But that is a tangent; we were talking about your age.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @6 /*Yes, we were and I was telling you that there is no question more rude among half-elves; if you know my age you can look at me and guess how much human blood I have.*/
== MAZZYJ @7 /*You are a *half* elf, is the answer not always one half?*/
== JAHEIRAJ @8 /*Hah, you would think so, but no. Elves consider only those of absolutely pure blood to be elves. Anyone with a single human ancestor, no matter how far back, is a half-elf. The more elven you are, the better. Some half-elves with mostly elven blood are even able to pass as elves for a while until they start showing signs of age.*/
= @9 /*But since you clearly meant no ill will, I will answer your question. I was born in Tethyr during the early stages of the civil war and each of my parents were true half-elves, meaning so am I. My fallen husband, Khalid, was three-quarters elven.*/
= @10 /*I remember being worried that he would outlive me, watch me grow old and die. Seems so foolish now... but there is your answer, halfling.*/
== MAZZYJ @11 /*That cannot be right. The Tethyr Civil War started in 1347, which would make you roughly the same age as <CHARNAME>.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @12 /*You know your history, but you are incorrect. The true war started in 1347 as you said, but the earliest stages of the conflict started in 1333 and I was born in 1334, the year of the Battle of Nightflames, when Crown Prince Rythan was killed by an army secretly sponsored by the king. My parents were killed in the riots in 1348 and I fled to join the druids after that.*/
== MAZZYJ @13 /*And in which season were you born?*/
== JAHEIRAJ @14 /*My parents always told me I was born on the day the first snow fell.*/
== MAZZYJ @15 /*Ah-hah! I have you beat by months. I was born in the spring. If you were a halfling, I could call you "little cousin." Maybe I will anyway.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @16 /**chuckle* Do I call you "big cousin" then?*/
== MAZZYJ @17 /*You could if you wish. Just remember are that I am your elder, you are young and naive, and you must always defer to my wisdom and experience.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @18 /**laughing* Thank you, Mazzy, I needed that. It is so easy for me to wallow in sorrow and regret.*/
== MAZZYJ @19 /*For me as well. Battle is a suitable diversion, but perhaps friendship is as well.*/
== JAHEIRAJ @20 /*Battle tends to rob us of our friends...*/
