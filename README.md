![If you want more of Mazzy, this mod is likely right for you!](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/6/6f/Mazzy_Fentan_NMAZZY_Portrait_BG2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180926125931)

# What This Mod Is
Mazzy MegaMod is a multi-faceted NPC mod from BCaesar and Ratatoskr that focuses on [Mazzy Fentan](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Mazzy_Fentan), the Halfling Almost-Paladin, and, among other things, includes a Mazzy frienship, a Mazzy Romance, and a way to roleplay Mazzy as being very Good-aligned or Evil-aligned.  It also has components regarding Aerie, Anomen, Clara, and inter-NPC romances.

# Mod Component 1: Main Mazzy Component
**1: Main Mazzy Component**
This mod, as the title states, includes a Mazzy romance and a friendship, a way for her to join the Order of the Radiant Heart, numerous discussions between Mazzy and other NPCs, and many new interjections.

To get the full Mazzy experience, you should also install the For The Good component.  We recommend avoiding this component if you plan to play an Evil-aligned protagonist as it gives Mazzy chances to kill you.

A: Mazzy Friendship/Romance:

- Mazzy Initiated Friendship Talks at set times/locations during the game (SOA & TOB)

- Mazzy Romance: Quest to start the romance in SOA (starts after the Underdark) & TOB. The SOA Quest has a friendship version as well.

- Some romance talks at set times during the game

- Additional talks with Mazzy's family.

- ToB Master Wraith scene and friendship/romance epilogues.

- Recurring Mazzy friendship/romance talks where you can choose the topic. (SOA & TOB)

- Breakup talks for many of the other romance options if you choose Mazzy over them.

- 3 ToB talks that do not require the friendship or romance.

B. Interjections, comments and reactions:

-Interjections and reactions by Mazzy throughout the game.

C. Imoen and Mazzy

- A series of optional friendship/romance talks that will play if you take Mazzy to Spellhold. Several alternate talks depending on who CHARNAME decides to romance.

- Includes 1 talk between Imoen and Viconia

- Talk sequence will continue/start in TOB if not already done.

- Includes additional dialogues if you are romancing Imoen or allow Aerie-Imoen using the Imoen Romance Mod.

D. Korgan and Mazzy conversations: 5 total (1 is an existing BG2 ToB conversation that was modified and moved. Parts of this series also play in TOB)

- The first conversation takes place 10 days after both are in your party.

- the 2nd when you rest in an inn after both the 1st conversation and their normal in-game banter have occurred.

- The 3rd when they're both in your party and able to talk again.

- The 4th conversation takes place several days after that. After this, he won't leave at high rep.

- There is also a stand-alone conversation in the docks if you talk to any of the commoner women there.

E. Jan and Mazzy conversations: 1 total. (Also in TOB)

- Takes place 3 days after both are in your party, upon rest in a dungeon, or outside.

F. Viconia and Mazzy:

- Mazzy comments and reacts when Viconia is at the stake.

- An entire series of optional friendship talks. About 18 additional conversations in all.

- A few additional talks if you are romancing either one of them.

- 3 additional ToB-only talks where Mazzy attempts to redeem Viconia.

G. Edwin & Mazzy conversations: 6 total (Also in TOB)

- They all trigger after the first Mazzy/Edwin banter as game time passes. Two will only play if you have an active Edwin romance.

- Additions to the Maevar quest sequence with Edwin as well. Should be compatible with alternatives.

H. Jaheira & Mazzy: 2 conversations (Also in TOB)

- Another two conversations may play if you romance one or the other.

I. Keldorn & Mazzy: 3 conversations (SOA & TOB)

-He will also sponsor her to join the Order of the Radiant Heart. This spans most of the game.

J. Mazzy & Valygar: 4 talks building off their in-game banters.

- 2 are ToB only.

K. Minsc & Mazzy: 1 talk.

L. Minsc, Jan, & Mazzy: 1 talk.

M. Mazzy & Lilarcor: 2 talks

N. Two quests with the harlots in the Athkatla Docks District.  Talk to a harlot with Mazzy in your party.  Talk to her again if you've destroyed the Shadow Thieves.

**2: Keepable Clara NPC (Human Hexxat)**
Now, Clara doesn't suddenly stop existing soon after recruiting her in the Copper Coronet.  We have reworked the end of the Hexxat intro quest so that you can kill Hexxat to keep Clara.  Clara is a Female Human Neutral Evil Thief who can change her kit type at will.  Although Clara starts out relatively weak, she levels up quickly and gains stats and abilities as she banters with other party NPCs.  You can also start a new ToB game and summon Clara to join you.

Mazzy MegaMod also includes an optional new soundset for Clara.  Full details are in a below section.

- You do not need Mazzy in your party to trigger this option. Just murder Hexxat in Dragomir's tomb and make sure you pick up her sack afterward.

- She should be summonable in TOB regardless of your choices and has multiple epilogues.

- Clara's soundset is optional, but if you turn on subtitles, she does have lines for all the standard comments.

- To change her kit, reform your party and remove her. The option will appear in the conversation when she talks to you afterward.

- Clara has banters/talks with every vanilla NPC, as well as [Saradas from the Saradas Magic II mod](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/Saradas-Magic-BG2) for the ToB part of the campaign.  Most of the banters improve Clara in some way and while a few are exclusive to SoA, the majority will play in ToB if you do not see them in SoA.

- She also has interjections throughout the game, SoA & ToB.

- An additional intricate scene if you kick her out of your party while at war with the Shadow Thieves, particularly if you have active romances.

- If you don't romance Anomen, Clara will do it for you; however, she has her own agenda and the romance goes down a very different path once he takes his test.  Includes content for SoA & ToB including a ToB Master Wraith scene.  (Optional)

- 8 Clara-Mazzy talks on philosophy:  2 are optional and mutually exclusive.

- 2 NPC quests involving Rose Bouquet, and another quest exclusive to For the Evil.  (Full details below.)  The first NPC quest will start once Aran is dead, while the second NPC quest and For the Evil quest can only be done in Chapter 6 of SoA or Chapter 18 of EET.

**3: Darkside Anomen: An Expansion for Evil Anomen**
This adds additional content to Chaotic Neutral (CN) Anomen if he fails his test. This is basically complete and is semi-optional.

- The bulk of the content requires someone to romance Anomenl however if you don't want to romance him then Clara can do it for you.  This leads to the same dialogues and benefit.  Once the romance is complete, you can remove one of them from your party without affecting the other. Works in SoA & ToB.

- An alternate ending the CN romance if Anomen fails his test. Now you can help him with Cor without losing him forever. This includes new ToB epilogues and a minor SoA quest.

- Fixes Anomen to use his appropriate sound files if he fails his test.

- Anomen no longer objects to Dorn's first quest after he fails his test. This helps you actually keep him in an evil party. Includes some extra lines and Chaotic Neutral options as well.

- A talk at the beginning of TOB that lets you choose his past.

- Fix for the Anomen romance if you break it by accident.

- Various interjections and fixes for evil Anomen.

**4. Minsc-Neera-Boo Romance: A romance of miniature giant proportions. (Optional)**
What none of you asked for, but you all secretly wanted. This is essentially finished, though we may add some more talks, interjections, and so forth as we feel like it. Now includes epilogues and a Master Wraith scene.

- Minsc, Neera, and Boo!: ~23 Talks (because BCaesar is an incorrigible matchmaker). Most will play in SoA or ToB. A few of them are ToB only, including their Master Wraith scene.

- Neera-Aerie: 1 witch talk in SoA.

- This will start if both are in your party and you are not romancing Neera. If you do romance Neera but end the romance, it will start soon after.

**5: Flying Aerie. (Optional)**
This is a mod for Aerie to get her wings back. It is finished, though as usual we reserve the right to add more later. There are three paths toward getting her wings back - the regeneration route, the Edwin route, and the Spell-Store route. All three routes can start in SoA and can be pursued simultaneously. They all finish in ToB. Like almost everything we write, you can pick up in ToB where you left off in SoA, so there is no need to stay in SoA just to finish - or even start - Flying Aerie.

Note that Flying Aerie is thematically incompatible with [Wings](https://github.com/Skitia/Wings) and flying spells from [OlvynSpells](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/76732/v2-5-0-olvynspells-150-new-spells-for-bg-ee-bg2-ee-iwd-ee-and-eet/p1), but they will likely install together.

- Viconia & Aerie: 5 conversations in SoA or ToB.

- Edwin & Aerie: 5 conversations: 2 in SoA or ToB and 3 in ToB only.

- Jaheira & Aerie: 1 conversation in SoA or ToB.

- Adjusted ToB dialogues and epilogues to account for her wings

- 11 NPC talks related to Aerie's wings: 10 in SoA or ToB and 1 in ToB only.

- 6 NPC/CHARNAME talks on the Wizard Wings Path in SoA or ToB.

- 2 store talks where you can ask about Aerie's wings in SoA.

- Find the right wizard and get Aerie's wings: ToB only.

- 12 Aerie talks as she tries to regain her wings: 9 in SoA or ToB and 3 in ToB only. (Optional)

**6: Dorn-Haer'Dalis Romance in SoA & ToB. (Optional)**
Another optional NPC romance, because Evil people need love too. This romance will begin in either SoA or ToB - and it continues into ToB if you started it earlier - and includes lots of snarky comments on all sides... as well as the joy of Haer'Dalis and his florid poetry.

- About 25 love talks across SoA & ToB, including a Master Wraith scene and an Aerie conflict.

- Includes additions to Dorn's quest with romance interjections and options throughout, various other interjections, new ToB epilogues, and some changes to Dorn's leaving dialogue.

- You will get the most content if Dorn and Haer'Dalis are committed to a romantic relationship with each other before Spellhold, but it is not required.

**7: Jaheira-Wilson Romance for SoA & ToB. (Optional)**
An optional romance between Jaheira and the secret NPC Wilson, that absolutely no one asked for and we wrote anyway. It will begin in SoA once you have both in your party if you are not romancing Jaheira yourself.

- In SoA, there's an NPC romance spanning ~26 love talks on a timer and 3 other talks based on events.

- These talks will continue into ToB, and there are another 6 talks if you finish them before the Naster Wraith Scene.

- Characters will interject when appropriate in an active romance.

- Includes a code to make getting Wilson in your party more obvious.

**8: Miscellaneous Stuff**
- Both the Talos and Lathander Temples figure out that you stole from them for Mae'Var and you have the option of returning the necklace and statuette later.

- This triggers whether you have Mazzy or not, and will hopefully stop breaking the game now.

- A fix in the Underdark so drow bands won't attack while you're disguised

- A bugfix in the Copper Coronet so that you can actually get into the back with Lehtinan's permission. This allows you to side with the slavers or lie to infiltrate their operations.

- Bugfix for Minsc actually rejoining your party after being charmed by Irenicus' dryads.

- Additional Drow massage options in Ust Natha.

- If you're fighting the thieves and didn't do Mae'Var's quest, you can now kill the man at the front desk to unlock the doors to the guild.

- Added a minor dialogue to wrap up Dorn's SoA quest.

- You can now sell the Cloak of Dragomir to Bodhi if you're working for her.

- If Dorn gives up his patron, he can pledge service to an Evil god at their temple to regain his awesome powers. Check your local Evil temple for details.

- An expansion for the Windspear Hills Quest to make the Order turn on you if you forget Garren Windspear's help. You can now fight your way to peace or victory if you're strong enough.

- Re-added the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart to fight you if you attack the Order of the Radiant Heart.  (They exist in game, but the way they're coded most people will never see them.)

# Mod Component 2: For the Evil (Optional)
Additional mod options that may be off-putting to some good players. We write our evil characters as fairly awful people in the main mod and this explores them more in depth; however, this is actually less disruptive than Hostile Mazzy to a normal game and we quite like how most of it turned out.

**1 Hexxat-Korgan Friendship: SoA Only**

- A series of 7 optional banters that trigger if you keep Hexxat and Korgan  in your party, leading to an odd and somewhat creepy friendship.  Several talks will only trigger on rests outside, so try mixing things up if they haven't talked in a while.

- The first talk starts after the in-game Korgan-Hexxat banter.

**2: Sarevok-Viconia Brief Romance: ToB Only**

- A series of about 5 romance talks following from their canon banters. The first will only trigger on rests in the pocket plane so keep that in mind.

- Another romance talk if CHARNAME was romancing Viconia.

- This will play if you are romancing Viconia. It will not play if you're romancing Sarevok using the [Sarevok Romance Mod](http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/810-sarevok-romance/).

**3: Hexxat-Viconia Banter**
- 4 optional conversations in SoA & ToB that play after their first in-game banter and before their last one.
- If you have a banter accelerator enabled you'll probably need to travel or rest often to see them all since their final in-game banter ends the "relationship."

**4. Bodhi NPC for SoA & ToB**
- Bodhi is fully functional, with some banters, dialogues, and epilogues. She is unlikely to get more content.

- SoA content is available if you worked for her in Chapter 3.  All Good-aligned vanilla recruitable party members are incompatible with her and will object to her being in your party. She is also the enemy of vanilla Drizzt - but probably not [Region of Terror Drizzt](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/Region-of-Terror) - and the Order of the Radiant Heart.

- Banters with Korgan, Clara, and Edwin.

- Character sounds.

- 2 Bodhi-Hexxat talks.

- Interjections.

- Should be completely compatible with the [Ascension Mod](https://github.com/InfinityMods/Ascension) since the game will register this version of Bodhi and Ascension Bodhi as two different characters.

**5: Bodhi-the-Elf NPC**
At the end of SoA, should you direct Bodhi to accept Queen Ellesime's offer, Bodhi-the-Elf will ask to come with you. She is a Chaotic Evil Elven monk. Good-aligned vanilla recruitable NPCs will again travel with her except for Mazzy, Anomen (if he's still with the Order), and Keldorn. Bodhi-the-Elf is a relatively quiet Easter-egg, much like the Wilson NPC was in BG2EE.

**6: Viconia in Ust Natha**

- Expanded quests and dialogues for Viconia when she's in the city of the Drow.

- Taken to its most evil conclusion, you can find yourself leading a demon and a small army of drow against the elves.

- Some crossmod content with objections for Good-aligned mod NPCs, the ones I happened to have installed while coding this.

**7: Viconia's Peace**

- A final quest for Chapters 6 & 7 in BG2 and Chapters 18 & 19 of EET builds off the Clara-Viconia banters and has minor crossmod content with a variety of NPCs. You must have defeated Bodhi and gotten the last Clara-Viconia NPC banter before this quest becomes available. We do not recommend starting this quest until you have finished everything you need to before the end-game... and that's all this documentation will mention about that.

**8: Miscellaneous Evil Options For the Main Character**

- An Evil player option with the dryads in Irenicus' dungeon.

- Minor Evil options with [Tiiro](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Tiiro), [Aulava](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Aulava), and [Am-Si](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Am-Si).

- Additional courtesan options in Athkatla's Bridge District and in Brynnlaw.

- A more Evil option with the dryad in the Windspear Hills.

- More immediate Evil option with Adalon in Underdark.

- If you have items that belonged to Drizzt's party and the wizard Malchor Harpell tries to take them back, you can fight him instead of automatically giving up the items.  (Technically, you could also do this in vanilla, but Harpell kept coming back until you stopped carrying gear from Drizzt and company.)

- You may sell the Dawn Ring to the Temple of Talos instead of returning it to the Temple of Lathander.

- You may fight the elves in BG2 Chapter 6 or EET Chapter 18 instead of doing what they demand.

- If you kill the Silver Dragon in the Underdark, you can now get Cromwell to make her scales into armor.  (The scales and armor already existed in ToB.)

# Mod Component 3: For the Good (Optional)
Additional mod options that might be annoying for a truly Evil-aligned party. With these, Mazzy and other party members will no longer sit idly by while you do horrible things. This makes things more consistent with other good characters' reactions and we recommend installing it for the full Mazzy experience; however, if you plan to be Evil and want Mazzy anyway, you should probably skip this part.

**1: Hostile Mazzy for SoA & ToB**
- Mazzy now correctly attacks you if your reputation gets too low.  (It was coded but now this bug is fixed.)

- If Mazzy and CHARNAME fight, other characters join a side or stay out of it.  Every vanilla character should talk so if a canon one doesn't, it's a bug.

- None of the options in [Tweaks Anthology](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Tweaks-Anthology) to keep your NPCs from leaving will stop this from triggering. This is coded differently than the canon ones.

- Mazzy will also attack if you do anything too Evil during certain quests, or attack the temples of Lathander, Helm or the Radiant Heart.

- Hexxat-Mazzy conflict in SoA & ToB.  This includes a conflict both when you first get Hexxat involving most of your good characters and a Mazzy specific conflict if they are both in your party later. (If the conversation ends with Mazzy taking a couple people vampire hunting, try letting things play out.)

- Additional Mazzy interjections - often very soon before she tries to kill you.

# Mod Component 4: Do NOT Allow Multiple ToB Epilogs to Play (Optional)
If you install this component then this mod's epilogues will override the standard TOB epilogues and most other mod epilogues. If you do not install this, you will get multiple epilogues where applicable, meaning you will see the existing epilogues, either from the game or from another mod you have installed, and our epilogues. No matter what you do, you will always see our epilogues:  They are unbreakable.

Please note that other mods may still overwrite the standard ToB epilogues regardless of this choice. Additionally, mods installed after this mod may cause duplicate epilogues since ours cannot be turned off the usual way.

# Mod Component 5: Soundset for Clara NPC (Optional)
This will install a basic soundset for the Clara NPC, including selection sounds, action sounds, and some other comments. It does not add voiced dialogue to her other talks. The voiced lines mostly do not match the text that will appear for Clara when you have subtitles turned on. This is not a bug.

# Mod Component 6: Alternative Mazzy Portrait (Optional)
![Default Mazzy Portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/6/6f/Mazzy_Fentan_NMAZZY_Portrait_BG2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180926125931)  ![Alternative Mazzy Portrait](https://github.com/Ratatoskr589/All-Things-Mazzy/raw/refs/heads/main/AllThingsMazzy/copy/Portrait/NMAZZYL.bmp)

# Compatibility Notes and Mod Install Order
Mazzy MegaMod should be compatible with most other mods. We've worked hard to make it that way since Ratatoskr has a LOT of mods installed; however, we cannot guarantee that our content will mesh with all other mods in terms of NPC characterization/personality. We tend to write as though no other mods are installed since there's just too many to keep track of, and in some cases, we take existing NPC's in the opposite direction from what other mods chose to do.

In addition, we have tried to account for the following mods in our code, meaning that our rest scenes don't trigger concurrently and you may see different dialogue if you have those mods installed (for example, Imoen may have a different interjection if you have active romance). Some of the crossmod aspects require the other mods to be installed first, but we've tried to code compatibility based solely on triggers as much as possible. See the "List of Mods with Crossmod Content" file for more details.

-Friendships/Banters: [Viconia Friendship[(https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/Viconia-Friendship) and the [IEP Banter Project](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/IEP-Extended-Banters). The Mazzy Friendship shouldn't break our mod if you have both installed, but they don't mesh well thematically.

-NPC Romances: [De'Arnise Romance](https://github.com/Pocket-Plane-Group/deArnise_Romance), [Edwin Romance](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/Edwin-Romance), [Haer'Dalis Romance](https://america.iegmc.com/haerdalis/), [Imoen Romance](http://imoen.blindmonkey.org/downloads.php), [Keldorn Romance](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Keldorn_Romance/releases), [Sarevok Romance](https://america.iegmc.com/sarevok/), [Yoshimo Romance](https://downloads.weaselmods.net/download/yoshimo-romance/), and all the vanilla romances.  The thematic compatibility varies.

-Miscellaneous Mods: [Alternatives](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Alternatives/releases), [Imoen4Ever](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Imoen4Ever), [Saradas Magic II](https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/Saradas_Magic_for_BG2) (and about a dozen other NPCs), the [Wilson Chronicles](https://downloads.weaselmods.net/download/wilson-chronicles/), [Smiling Imp's BG1 NPCs in BG2](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/BG1-NPCs-for-SoA-ToB), and [NPC Strongholds](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QFmCGFy7ANiwNxCEDCepQn728RwBCZCT/view?usp=share_link).

Known Compatibility Issues:

- NPC Strongholds will break one of our Mazzy quests if installed after Mazzy MegaMod. In order to avoid this, NPC Strongholds must be installed before Mazzy MegaMod so our fix will run.

- The 'Improved Fiends and Celestials' component of Sword Coast Stratagems MAY break our Ust Natha expansion because it replaces a script file that we use. You'll either need to install that component before this mod, skip that component, or do some Near Infinity editing afterwards.  ([DavidW of SCS and BCaesar of Mazzy MegaMod were discussing things here](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/38421-does-this-mod-overwrite-demlordbcs/).  Use SCS with the Mazzy MegaMod Demon Lord component at your own risk!)

# Notes About Mazzy Friendship & Romance
While some talks will trigger at specific points, this friendship & romance is primarily nonlinear. You can choose what you talk about and as long as you're not a total asshole or super Evil, Mazzy will be your friend. You cannot break the friendship otherwise, though you can ask her to stop talking to you, and her tolerance for jokes will increase over time. There is a sense of humor beneath that stern exterior. If you break the friendship by accident, you will have one chance to get it back.

For the romance, there are no restrictions on race, gender, or class. As long as your charisma doesn't suck and you aren't illiterate, you will have a chance.  Male halflings will have the easiest time, but 12 CHA is the highest stat requirement. You must complete Mazzy's quest and bring her with you to rescue Imoen in order to begin her romance in BG2 Chapter 6 or EET Chapter 18.

Romancing others will not stop you from romancing Mazzy, though for most romances, you will have to make a choice if you are already committed. It will be very clear when that moment comes and Mazzy generally won't care if you commit to another romance afterwards. Once the romance is active, you will have additional choices for your talks and depending on your choices, it can get fairly explicit. We don't have sex scenes per se but Mazzy is happy to discuss such things as frankly as you wish. The romance can be activated in ToB and an active romance can be continued.

# Mod Installation
Once installed, you shouldn't need to restart your game, though you may have already missed some interjections.

We have put so much redundancy into our coding that you should be able to have a couple conversations, kick Mazzy out of your party, delete the mod, play half the game, get Mazzy back in your party, reinstall the mod, and have it pick up right where it left off. You can break things if you try, but we've tried to make it difficult.

When reinstalling a newer version of this mod you should always uninstall the older version, delete the folder, and then copy in the new folder containing the later version of All Things Mazzy.
